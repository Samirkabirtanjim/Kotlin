## 🔰 What Is Inheritance?
* Inheritance lets you create a new class (child/subclass) that inherits properties and functions from an existing class (parent/superclass).
---
## 💡 Why Use It?
* Avoid code duplication
* Represent real-world relationships (e.g., Dog is an Animal)
* Reuse and extend existing class functionality
---
## 🧠 Imagine this:
You have a general blueprint called Animal.

All animals:
* Have a name
* Can make a sound
* 
Now, you want to make a Dog. A dog is an animal, but it can also bark — something not all animals do.
Instead of writing everything again in Dog, you say:

```sql
“Hey Dog, you are also an Animal. Just take everything from Animal, and add your special features (like barking).”
```
---
## 👨‍💻 Code Breakdown:
```kotlin
// Animal is a parent (base/super) class
open class Animal(val name: String) {
    fun makeSound() {
        println("$name makes a sound")
    }
}

// Dog is a child (derived/sub) class that inherits from Animal
class Dog(name: String) : Animal(name) {
    fun bark() {
        println("$name barks")
    }
}

// Main program
fun main() {
    val myDog = Dog("Rocky")
    myDog.makeSound() // Comes from Animal class
    myDog.bark()      // Comes from Dog class
}
```
---
💡 Notes:
* open means the class can be inherited (Kotlin doesn’t allow inheritance by default).
* : Animal(name) means Dog is getting everything from Animal.
