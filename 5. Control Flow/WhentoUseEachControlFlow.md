## 🔹 Kotlin Control Flow Guide

Understanding when to use different control flow structures helps you write clear and efficient code. Here's a quick guide:

| Control Flow | When to Use                                                                 |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `if-else`    | Use for simple true/false or comparison-based logic.                        |
| `when`       | Use when you need to check multiple specific conditions. (Like `switch` in Java/C) |
| `for` loop   | Use when you want to loop over a range, list, or array.                     |
| `while` loop | Use when you want to loop **as long as** a condition is true.               |
| `do-while`   | Use when you want the loop to run **at least once**, and then check a condition. |

### ✅ Example Use Cases

- `if-else`: Checking if age is above 18
- `when`: Matching menu choices or grades
- `for`: Iterating over a list of names
- `while`: Waiting for a task to finish (as long as status is incomplete)
- `do-while`: Asking user input until they type "exit"
