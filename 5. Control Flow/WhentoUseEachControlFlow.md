ðŸ”¹ When to Use Each Control Flow
--
Control Flow	Use When
if-else	You need simple true/false or comparison logic
when	You have multiple specific conditions to check (like switch-case in other languages)
for loop	You want to loop over a range, list, or array
while loop	You want to loop until a condition is no longer true (condition first)
do-while	You want to loop at least once before checking the condition
